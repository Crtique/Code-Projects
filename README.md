# Use of the Github
This is used for me and other friends or peers of mine to access character controllers I decide to make. This will be using primarily C# code, and use only Unity. I kindly do ask that the Code that is on this Github to not be copy pasted and use more of a resource and refrence, but if that crunch time is coming, be more than welcome to copy paste. If you have "critiques" to the code I make to I would LOVE the feedback to improve my skills.
# Would I add GameMaker items
I will eventually I want to dedicate this to first C# projects and specific kinds of character cntroller that can be used within Unity. Though I would like to add/create some using GameMaker in the near future with it not being just chracter controllers.
